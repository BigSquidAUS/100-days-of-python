This repository serves as a personal archive of all the coding projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 course on Udemy, taught by Dr. Angela Yu.
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code

The course is designed to build Python programming skills through daily coding challenges and projects. Each project in this repo corresponds to a specific day or topic from the course, and they progressively increase in complexity.

ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here
Beginner to intermediate Python projects
- A variety of applications including games, data manipulation tools, and mini utilities
- Use of core Python concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, classes, and more
- Integration with libraries such as random, tkinter, pandas, and flask (in later days)

ðŸ“š Why This Repo Exists
This repo serves multiple purposes:
- To track my own progress through the course
- As a reference for revisiting earlier lessons
- To share with others who might be learning Python and want to see working examples
