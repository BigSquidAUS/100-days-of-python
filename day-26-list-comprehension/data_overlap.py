"""Data Overlap
ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD ðŸ’ª 
Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line. 
You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files. 

e.g. if file1.txt contained: 
1 
2 
3

and file2.txt contained: 
2
3
4
result = [2, 3]
IMPORTANT:  The output should be a list of integers and not strings!
Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop. """
